    "Chapter 06 covers predictive modeling using forecasting, linear regression, and multilayer perceptrons (MLP) models. These chapters do not go deep enough into the topic to truly understand what is going on. There are many details that are missing (just think about how long you talked about linear regression in INST314). The goal is to have an idea of what will happen to the datesets that we are preparing for analysis. It also turns out that a great way to identify problems with a dataset is to try to answer questions using it."
